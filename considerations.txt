To adapt the program for **multiple graphs/curves**, focus on improving the **mask creation and thresholding** to handle variability between different graphs, followed by **localized processing** for each curve. Here's how:

1. **Adaptive Masking & Thresholding**:
   - Replace **global thresholds** for rows/columns with **local thresholds** (e.g., `skimage.filters.threshold_local` or Otsuâ€™s method) to account for per-graph intensity variations.
   - Example: For each segmented graph region, compute thresholds based on its intensity distribution instead of using fixed values like `110000` or `50000`.

2. **Graph Segmentation**:
   - Use connected component analysis or contour detection (e.g., `cv2.findContours`) to identify individual graph regions in the image. This isolates processing for each graph.

3. **Per-Graph Processing**:
   - Apply morphological operations (opening, skeletonize) **independently to each segmented graph**. Adjust the disk size (e.g., `se = disk(5)`) based on the curve thickness in each region to preserve thin lines.

4. **Multi-ROI Handling**:
   - Loop over detected graph regions to process each curve separately. Modify the current fixed `x_start`, `x_end` logic to dynamically assign ROIs per graph.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Overlay skeletons for all detected curves by iterating through segmented regions. Ensure distinct colors (e.g., red, blue) for different curves using `overlay[s_roi] = [255,0,0]`, `overlay[another_roi] = [0,0,255]`.

**Why mask adjustments are critical**: Global thresholds (like `sum(I, axis=1) < 110000`) may incorrectly identify curves in overlapping/intense regions. Local adaptive thresholds and per-graph masking ensure curves in all graphs are detected regardless of their position or intensity. Morphological steps refine these results but depend on accurate initial masks.
